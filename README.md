# RegressionTreeMap
Regression tree project made for M.A.P. exam.
This project is based on regression, so the prediction of the value of a numerical attribute associated to an example.
For example, considering datas of old clients of a bank and their payments, you can predict the debt of the client with the bank.
These functions are learned using a tree form. This tree is called regression tree and it is constructed by using learning techniques.
The 'Base' folder contains the projects that can be runned by CLI.
Otherwise, if you prefer a GUI, check the 'Estensione' folder.
